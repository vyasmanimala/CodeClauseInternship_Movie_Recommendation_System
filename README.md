# Personalized Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

Welcome to the Personalized Movie Recommendation System! This project utilizes Python and data science to recommend movies based on user preferences. With the power of Scikit-learn, ipywidgets, and ipython.display, it provides an interactive and engaging movie search experience.

## Key Libraries Used

- **NumPy (üìä):** For numerical operations and efficient array handling.
- **Pandas (üêº):** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn (üîç):** Employs TfidfVectorizer and cosine similarity for computing similarity scores.
- **ipywidgets (üîç):** Enables the creation of an interactive search function for a user-friendly experience.
- **ipython.display (üîó):** Used for displaying the search function and its output.
